# CloudHuffer Solution

This solution contains three projects:

- **CloudHufferApi**: ASP.NET Core Web API backend
- **CloudHufferApi.Tests**: xUnit backend tests
- **CloudHufferWeb**: Angular frontend (scaffolded with Angular CLI)

## Structure

- Backend code: `CloudHufferApi/`
- Backend tests: `CloudHufferApi.Tests/`
- Frontend code: `CloudHufferWeb/`

## Getting Started

1. Build and run the backend:
   ```sh
   dotnet build CloudHufferApi/CloudHufferApi.csproj
   dotnet run --project CloudHufferApi/CloudHufferApi.csproj
   ```
2. Build and run the frontend:
   ```sh
   cd CloudHufferWeb
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Next Steps
- Implement features in the appropriate folders (Controllers, Services, etc.)
- Add tests in `CloudHufferApi.Tests`
- Use the Angular app for the user interface
